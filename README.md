# Analyzing Transportation Patterns Using Chicago Taxi Trip for Urban Planning Insights
Urban planning is an important aspect of designing cities to meet the infrastructure needed to support the livelihood of tens of millions of residents. Transportation in particular has a critical impact on peopleâ€™s decision to accept employment, how they spend their time, places they visit, and even business locations. This exploration of Chicago taxi and service data will provide an insight on traffic conditions, travel expenses, and hotspots for visitation in the city which can be used for city planning purposes.

## Problem definition
The project aims to derive insights that can inform urban planning, improve traffic management, and optimize transportation services in Chicago by identifying peak demand zones, understanding the impact of traffic congestion on trip durations, and evaluating fare patterns across different variables.
- Analyze how fares vary by distance, time of day, location, and traffic condition.
- Analyze the pickup and drop-off timestamps to identify peak demand times and the most frequented areas in the city.
- Use the difference between pickup and drop-off times to study trip duration patterns.
- Identify locations with frequent congestion and see how they correlate with the day and time.
